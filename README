Crappy HTML5 page to control my DirecTV console. 

You can load this into it's own page, or store it locally. 
Obviously, it needs UI love, but it's mostly laid out with tags.
I'd love to have this crawl the local net with workers, but I can't get the local IP in Javascipt. 

I'll be tweaking this every so often. Feel free to yell at me that this should use j-random framework, or that I'm killing kittens with -moz  styles. It works.
